= Remote Sensing Tools

This repository contains a set of tools for remote sensing. Currently, the
project has 3 tools, some of which depend on the ArcGIS API.

1. A tool for processing Landsat imagery and extracting bands and regions of interest.
2. A tool for sampling an area and extracting matching areas from different images with different resolutions.
3. A tool for building a regression model from classified imagery and computing fractional cover using that model and NDVI from a Landsat image.
